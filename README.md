# What is HireGauge?
HireGauge is a platform that enables employers to recruit the most suitable candidates for employment positions. 

# How does HireGauge improve the recruitment process?
The application achieves this by making potential employees take multiple-choice examinations that are essentially skill-based assessments. The exams are composed of questions aimed at gauging a specific skill. Depending on the employer's requirement for a particular workrole, the exam may contain one or more questions aimed at measuring a particular skill. For instance, if the position of a PHP developer is vacant at a software house called ABC, the assessments presented to candidates may contain more questions that gauge PHP syntax than other skills such as general problem-solving. Potential employees will not be judged on the basis of their overall score on the assessments, rather they will be judged in each individual skill area. For example, if two candidates, Adam and Ben, appear for a PHP developer assessment, and they score 88 and 85 points out of a hundred respectively, then these scores will not be the only determining factor. Assuming that Adam scores fewer points than Ben on the PHP syntax skill area, then the employer may prefer Ben over Adam as the workrole may be heavily dependent on this skill area.
